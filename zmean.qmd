# Exploratory Data Analysis 

print(summary(diet_data))

# Visualization: Weight Loss by Diet
ggplot(diet_data, aes(x = as.factor(Diet), y = Weight_Loss)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = as.factor(Diet))) +
  labs(title = "Weight Loss Distribution by Diet", x = "Diet", y = "Weight Loss (kg)") +
  theme_minimal()

# Interpretation: From this plot, it looks like people on Diet 1 lost more weight on average 
# compared to the other two diets. There’s a lot of overlap between Diets 2 and 3, so they 
# might not be very different from each other.

# Visualization: Weight Loss by Gender
ggplot(diet_data, aes(x = as.factor(gender), y = Weight_Loss)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = as.factor(gender))) +
  labs(title = "Weight Loss Distribution by Gender", x = "Gender (0 = Female, 1 = Male)", y = "Weight Loss (kg)") +
  theme_minimal()

# Interpretation: For gender, the boxplot shows that men and women lost similar amounts of weight. 
# There doesn’t seem to be a big difference, but we’ll confirm this with statistical tests.

#  Mean Values by Gender and Diet
mean_table <- diet_data %>%
  group_by(Diet, gender) %>%
  summarize(Mean_Weight_Loss = mean(Weight_Loss, na.rm = TRUE))
print(mean_table)

# Interpretation: This table shows the average weight loss for each combination of diet and gender. 
# Diet 1 consistently shows higher weight loss for both men and women, while Diets 2 and 3 are 
# pretty close to each other.

# One-Way ANOVA: Diet Effect
fit_diet <- aov(Weight_Loss ~ as.factor(Diet), data = diet_data)
summary(fit_diet)

# Post-hoc test: Tukey's HSD
tukey <- TukeyHSD(fit_diet)
print(tukey)

# R-squared for Diet
diet_anova <- tidy(fit_diet)
ss_total <- sum(diet_anova$sumsq)
r_squared_diet <- diet_anova$sumsq[1] / ss_total
print(paste("R-squared for Diet:", r_squared_diet))

# Interpretation: The ANOVA results show that diet has a significant impact on weight loss (p < 0.01). 
# Tukey’s HSD test tells us that Diet 1 is much better than Diets 2 and 3, but there’s no big difference 
# between Diets 2 and 3. The R-squared value (~12.85%) means that diet explains about 13% of the variation 
# in weight loss, which is decent.

# One-Way ANOVA: Gender Effect
fit_gender <- aov(Weight_Loss ~ as.factor(gender), data = diet_data)
summary(fit_gender)

# Interpretation: When I look at gender, the ANOVA shows that it doesn’t have a significant effect on 
# weight loss (p = 0.86). So, weight loss seems to be pretty similar for men and women regardless of diet.

# Two-Way ANOVA: Diet and Gender Interaction
fit_interaction <- aov(Weight_Loss ~ as.factor(Diet) * as.factor(gender), data = diet_data)
summary(fit_interaction)

# R-squared for Interaction Model
interaction_anova <- tidy(fit_interaction)
r_squared_interaction <- sum(interaction_anova$sumsq[1:3]) / sum(interaction_anova$sumsq)
print(paste("R-squared for Interaction Model:", r_squared_interaction))

# Interpretation: The two-way ANOVA shows that diet is still important (p < 0.01), but now I also see 
# that the interaction between diet and gender is significant (p = 0.048). This means that how much weight 
# someone loses on a diet might depend on whether they’re male or female. The interaction model explains 
# more variation than just diet or gender alone, so it’s the best model overall.

#Final Summary
# Overall, I found that diet has a big impact on weight loss, with Diet 1 being the most effective. 
# Gender by itself doesn’t seem to matter much, but when I look at the interaction between diet and gender, 
# it becomes clear that gender affects how well the diets work. The interaction model is the best at explaining 
# weight loss because it considers both diet and gender together.
